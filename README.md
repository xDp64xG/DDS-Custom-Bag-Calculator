# DDS-Custom-Bag-Calculator

Currently this only does custom bag counts through a text file, which can do multiple amounts at once! When you're doing drug runs on DDS, input the clients/dealers numbers, and run the code, and will give you the biggest amount you can take out(this example, someone wants 153 grams of 'blank' and the code will run through 500 grams, and then the clients amount they want minus the biggest bag you can make, then give you the amount to put back up to get the exact custom bag size!
